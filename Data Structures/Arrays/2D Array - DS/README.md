# 2D Array - DS

> You are given a 2D array with dimensions 6*6. An hourglass in an array is defined as a portion shaped like this:

```
a b c
  d
e f g
```

> For example, if we create an hourglass using the number 1 within an array full of zeros, it may look like this:

```
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

> Actually, there are many hourglasses in the array above. The three topmost hourglasses are the following:

```
1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0
  1         0         0
1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0
```

> The sum of an hourglass is the sum of all the numbers within it. The sum for the hourglasses above are 7, 4, and 2, respectively.

> In this problem, you have to print the largest sum among all the hourglasses in the array.
