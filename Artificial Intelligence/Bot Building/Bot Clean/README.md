# Bot Clean

> The goal of Artificial Intelligence is to create a rational agent (Artificial Intelligence 1.1.4). An agent gets input from the environment through sensors and acts on the environment with actuators. In this challenge, you will program a simple bot to perform the correct actions based on environmental input.

> Meet the bot MarkZoid. It's a cleaning bot whose sensor is a head mounted camera and whose actuators are the wheels beneath it. It's used to clean the floor.

> The bot here is positioned at the top left corner of a 5*5 grid. Your task is to move the bot to clean all the dirty cells.
